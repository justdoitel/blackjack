To run this code, you'd need to have JVM installed. Then you can simply open the Card.class file. If that's not working, try opening it via the terminal by going to the folder where the file is located and then running `Java Card`.   

If you get a "command not found" error (or something of that sort), make sure you've correctly [installed Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) and that it's [added to Path](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html)   

Feel free to look at the course code in Card.java and modifying it as you see fit. Once done, don't forget to compile it using javac before running it using the `Java` command.
